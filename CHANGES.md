# Changes being done to prepare for moving data to new system.

Changes are being made in recipes_new.dtd to handle new data format.

-   Removing all XML entities defined in the DTD.
    -   Most systems now handle special characters (E.g., degree symbol and
        trademark symbol) directly.
    -   Plan on moving to a different input format where entities are not
        handled.
