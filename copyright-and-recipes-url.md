# Copyrights and recipe data

Before adding this repo as a public repo, I did a bit of searching on recipes
and copyrights.  Most seemed somewhat consistent.

The URL `http://paleomagazine.com/recipe-copyright/` had a lot of information
and description about the particulars. While I am not a lawyer, I believe that
the recipes here should be fine.

The claims on most places that I read was that

- The list of ingredients and amounts are not covered by copyrights.
- The claim is that this is also true for the steps for making the item.
- What is copyrightable are the following:
    - "Expressive elaborations" such as how the recipe came about.
    - Photos or illustrations. (Take your own pictures or find a free one.)

Also, it is good form to state source of recipe or if derived from a recipe
to give credit to the source. (E.g., "adapted from" or "inspired by") The
post goes on to say that it is OK to call it your own if you change three or
more ingredients (unless the original was so unique that your recipe still
looks pretty similiar, in which case they suggest using "inspired by").

I tried to include the source of the recipes, but when I inherited my mom's
recipes, who knows where she got them from or if they were handed down in the
family.
