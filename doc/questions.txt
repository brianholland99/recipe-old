Oh by the way, the libxml2 package has a program called xmllint.
xmllint --valid --noout 
will check the validity of the XML against the DTD and
out put errors.  It caught one error in some new stuff since
I had put in "Quick & Easy Baked Beans" and it caught the
"&" which either had to be replaced "&amp;" if I wanted
the "&".


I added Jim's patch to the XSL script for HTML.
We have now have 53 recipes.
------------------------------------------------

measure element:

It also complained about all of the recipes where I had an ingredient
with mo measure.  This was for things like chocolate syrup for
topping.  I think it may be an error in the parsing unless
I misunderstand the notation for DTDs.

The ingredient definition was

<!ELEMENT ingredient ((measure*)|(min-measure+,max-measure+))>

Which I take as either 0 or more mesure elements or one or more
of each min-measure and max-measure.

I chnaged it to

<!ELEMENT ingredient (measure*|(min-measure+,max-measure+))

to see if the lack of a paren would make a difference but
only got it to work by adding a '?'.

<!ELEMENT ingredient (measure*|(min-measure+,max-measure+))?>

------------------------------------------------

yield element:

The yield element still feels strange. I had a recipe that
said "Serves 8-12". Maybe a simple string will do. It can't be used
to figure out how much to make to do something like feed 20, but
it can be complex anyway.

------------------------------------------------

measure's unit attribute:

In the documentation, we had originally stated that the units should
be spelled out instead of abbrieviated.  I fixed Jim's samples up to
follow this but what do we want to do?  Either an XSL can substitute
the abbreviation for those that want it rendered as an abbrieviation
or we can start with a standard set of abbreviations and an XSL script
could convert it to the full thing or a different abbrievation
depending on the preference of the user.  If metric is used, I expect
abbrieviations to be the standard such as "cc", "kg", etc..  

So I suggest a standard set of abbrieviations for metric.  At
the time that we first documented this we hadn't spent too much
time thinking about metric so didn't say anything about this.

I can live with either for the non-metric as long as
it's consistent.  I have been used to tsp and tbsp for
teaspoon and tablespoon but I remember that when we were
first discussing it, Elmo was familiar with other.
