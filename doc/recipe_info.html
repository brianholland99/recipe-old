<h2><a name="Reason1">Reason for an XML format for recipes</a></h2>

<p>There are several  advantages of an XML format for recipes. Since
formatting of recipes is a personal preference, stylesheets can render the
data in whatever format a user wants without changing the source file.  This
would allow users to share recipes without having to change them to suit their
display tatses.  In addition, a tool could be written that extracts the
information to create a shopping list. Another possible tool is one that given
a list of a few major ingredients from the refrigerator could locate recipes
that only use those items plus ingredients that the user has previously
declared as assumed available such as most spices. If this format gets
developed to a reasonably simple but powerful definition, the community could
be motivated to start exchanging recipes in this format rather than stright
text.</p>

<h2><a name="Creation">Creation of XML recipes documents</a></h2>

<p>The creation of XML recipes documents can be accomplished via any of a
number of XML editor or any text editor.  The current problem is that the
editors don't natively make the entry as easy as just typing in the recipe.
The editors still seem to expect that the person entering the recipes
understand basic XML.   Some of the editors do have ways of creating entry
forms but that hasn't been experimented yet. Maybe a separate application that
would ask the user whether they had a recipe with groups or just one stage
would be useful.</p>

<h2><a name="Transformi">Transforming XML recipes documents to various
forms</a></h2>

<p>Transofrmation appears to work well for the most part.  Since XML
Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) 1.0 is a recommendation, there are
several engines which can perfom the required transformations.  Converting to
HTML works nicely.  The HTML is easily veiwable but is limited in its ability
to do page layouts.</p>

<p>Fortunately,  XML Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects (XSL-FO) is being
designed and allows page layouts that can put the recipes onto 8.5x11 pages,
4x6 cards, or 3x5 cards.Converting through XSL-FO to create page layouts works
well using XSLT. The basic problem is that XSL-FO has just made it to release
candidate status so is just stablizing. Once it finally becomes a
recommendation, more software supporting this format should become available.
At the moment, there are no browsers that support it directly.  There are few
tools that will render the XSL-FO format in PDF. The two that have been
experimented with for the recipes are FOP (Open Source from Apache) and the
XEP evaulation version (commercial from RenderX).  The XEP program appears to
wok better on some of the sample things attempted such as borders.  Both tools
are being worked on so will likely support the complete XSL-FO eventally. Both
tools also require a Java VM.</p>

<h2><a name="walkthroug">A walkthrough of "recipes.dtd"</a></h2>

<p>The recipes.dtd file is the current definition of the recipes XML format. 
Now that the schemas have been published as a formal recommendadtion, the DTD
will be converted to a schema which has the power to help define the types and
other restrictions for elements and attributes.</p>

<p>The XML DTD for recipes was designed to be simple but flexibile enough to
handle the abnormal cases in recipes. What follows is intended to be a
description of the recipe DTD and the reasons behoind the structure and
elements chosen. There are two DTD's which we located on the net which really
attempted to address recipes. The first was recipes.dtd which can be found off
the page at "http://starship.python.net/crew/amk/recipe/". That version 0.01
DTD was developed by A.M. Kuchling (amk1@bigfoot.com) and was dated March 14,
1999. That was the starting point for developing this DTD. Some of the parts
seemed to contain a little too much such as allowing all sorts of HTML pieces
in the comments. Others did not handle some of the various recipes that we had
seen. After the new DTD had been developed, a second DTD called Dessert.dtd
was found which was dated January 1, 2000. The "Dessert.dtd" file can be found
at "ftp://ftp.mindspring.com/users/jsaiya/Dessert.dtd" and was written by
James Saiya. From an initial look, it appears to handle all sorts of things
including nutritional information. It hasn't been looked at yet to see if it
can handle some of the cases that we have taken into account. The intent in
our design was to be flexible but SIMPLE. Now the new DTD structure:</p>
<hr>

<h4>recipes:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT recipes (recipe)+&gt;</pre>

<p>The recipes element was intended to be the root element. It can contain one
or more recipes.</p>
<hr>

<h4>recipe:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT recipe
    (authors?,
     source?,
     category*,
     image?,
     (ingredients | (group,group+)),
     steps?,
     yield?,
     comment?,
     background?)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST recipe title CDATA #REQUIRED
                 id ID #IMPLIED&gt;</pre>

<p>All recipes must have a title as an atrribute, an optional authors, an
optional source, optional category(s), an optional image, ingredients or group
information, optional steps, an optional yield element, an optional comment,
and an optional background.  The ingredients element is used if it is a single
part recipe and the group elements are used if it is a multiple part
recipe.</p>

<p>Example:  &lt;recipe title="Chocolate Cake"&gt;  ,,,  &lt;/recipe&gt;</p>
<hr>

<h4>authors:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT authors (#PCDATA)&gt;</pre>

<p>The author element is optional and should list the author(s) of the recipe
if known. This element is text. Example: &lt;authors&gt;Julia
Child&lt;/authors&gt;</p>
<hr>

<h4>source:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT source (#PCDATA|emph)*&gt;</pre>

<p>The source is an optional element describing where the recipe was obtained
from. This element can contain mixed emph elements and text.  Examples:
&lt;source&gt;Betty Crocker Cookbook&lt;/source&gt; or
&lt;source&gt;Mom&lt;/source&gt;</p>
<hr>

<h4>category:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT category EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST category name CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;</pre>

<p>"category" is an optional element describing the type of dish that the
recipe makes. The category is entered in the name element. Example:
&lt;category name="Cake"/&gt; A commonly agreed-upon set of categories will be
more useful than arbitrary entries. Suggested categories are the
following:</p>
<pre>     "Appetizer and Snack"
     "Beverage"
     "Beef and Pork"
     "Bread"
     "Cake"
     "Candy"
     "Chicken"
     "Cookie"
     "Dessert"
     "Egg and Cheese"
     "Fish and Seafood"
     "Pie"
     "Salad and Dressing"
     "Sauce and Relish"
     "Soup and Stew"
     "Vegetable"</pre>
<hr>

<h4>image</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT image EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST image src CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;</pre>

<p>"image" is an optional element. It's purpose is to point to a file
containing a picture of the prepared food. The src atrtribute should be a URI.
At the present, the suggested encoding is PNG. This has no legal hassles like
those that concern the GIF format. Embedded base64 may be considered in the
future. Example: &lt;image src="ccake.png"/&gt;</p>
<hr>

<p><strong>ingredients</strong></p>

<p>&lt;!ELEMENT ingredients (ingredient|choices)+&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!ATTLIST ingredients id ID #IMPLIED&gt;</p>

<p>The ingredients element hold one or more ingredient or choices
elements.</p>
<hr>

<h4>ingredient</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT ingredient ((measure*)|(min-measure+,max-measure+))&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST ingredient
                name      CDATA #REQUIRED 
                id        ID    #IMPLIED
                form      CDATA #IMPLIED
                optional  (yes|no) 'no'                
&gt;</pre>

<p>"ingredient" is used to describe one ingredient. It consists of a required
name and may be empty. Since no measures are required for an ingredient, it
can be used for things like "whipped cream" where the steps might state "add
whipped cream as desired". If the measure is specified, it can include
multiple measure elements or a range denoted by one or more min-measure
elements and one or more max-measure elements. Multiple measures for one
ingredient allow quirky measurements such as 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour.
Ingredients Examples: &lt;ingredient name="brown sugar" form="firmly
packed"&gt;&lt;measure .../&gt;&lt;/ingredient&gt;</p>
<hr>

<h4>measure, min-measure, max-measure:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT *measure EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST *measure
                qty       CDATA #REQUIRED
                unit      CDATA #IMPLIED
                precision (exact|approximate) "exact"
&gt;</pre>

<p>The definitions above appear once for each of measure, min-measure, and
max-measure where "*measure" appears. The qty attribute is required but the
unit attribute is optional. This handles things like "1 cup flour" or "1
apple". As shown the exact is the default for precision but approximate can
also be specified. If multiple measures appear, they should be added. A
negative qty will allow measure such as 1 cup less 1 tablespoon flour.</p>

<p>Guidelines: Spell out unit such as tablespoon rather than tbsp or T -- That
will make it less confusing between readers. Use singular unit rather than
plural such as 2 tablespoon vs. 2 tablespoons -- The program doing the
rendering can plurarize the unit when it makes sense (it may be asked to
double the recipe anyway). The rendering program should use "plus" and "less"
when doing additions ("-" should be used for ranges) -- Ex: 1 cup - 1 cup plus
2 tablespoons.</p>
<hr>

<h4>choices:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT choices (choice, choice+)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST choices id ID #IMPLIED&gt;</pre>

<p>"choices" consist of at least two choice  elements. This allows such things
as "1 cup walnuts" or "1 cup pecans" and more complex choices where multiple
items may be replaced by one or more items.</p>
<hr>

<h4>choice:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT choice (ingredient+, comment?)&gt;</pre>

<p>This element simply holds one or more ingredient elements and an optional
comment.  The comment is there for things such as "Makes a firmer topping" or
"Add 5 minutes to baking"</p>
<hr>

<h4>group:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT group (ingredients,steps?)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST group name CDATA #REQUIRED
                id   ID    #IMPLIED
&gt;</pre>

<p>The "group" element is expected to hold ingredients and steps for distinct
parts of the item such as "cake" and "filling". The person entering the steps
could place the steps in the common steps area for the recipe. It is suggested
that the steps should be split into their groups and use the common steps for
instructions on combining the parts. Stylesheets then have the option of
printing the steps separate or placing them at the end.</p>
<hr>

<h4>steps:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT steps (step)+&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST steps id ID #IMPLIED&gt;</pre>

<p>Steps consists of one or more step elements.</p>
<hr>

<h4>step:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT step (#PCDATA | emph)*&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST step id ID #IMPLIED&gt;</pre>

<p>Step elements can contain combinations of emph elements and plain text.
Various sources of recipes define the steps as single instructions or a few
instructions together. Either is acceptable.</p>
<hr>

<h4>yield:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT yield EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST yield
             serves      CDATA   #IMPLIED
             count       CDATA   #IMPLIED
             measurement CDATA   #IMPLIED
             size        CDATA   #IMPLIED
             descriptive CDATA   #IMPLIED&gt;
&gt;</pre>

<p>There are various ways to describe yield. This was intened to cover the
common ones. Each of the attributes may be used alone. The count attribute may
be combined with size. The count should be a number such as 12 rather than "1
dozen". The DTD method of declaring this makes it difficult to describe this
unless yield was split into more than one element. A possiblity? Do any
recipes list multiple styles of yield such as 'Makes 2 liters, Serves 8'?</p>

<p>Examples: "Serves 12", "8 servings", "4-5 servings", "2 dozen", "Makes 24",
"36 bars", "2 liters", "1 1/2 Pounds", "2 cups", '10" Pie Crust', '2 9" Pie
Crust' ...</p>
<pre>So, the list above would become:
  &lt;yield serves="12"/&gt;
  &lt;yield serves="8"/&gt;
  &lt;yield serves="4-5"/&gt;

  &lt;yield count="24"/&gt;
  &lt;yield count="24"/&gt;
  &lt;yield count="36" descriptive="bars"/&gt;

  &lt;yield measurement="2 liters"/&gt;
  &lt;yield measurement="1 1/2 pounds"/&gt;
  &lt;yield measurement="2 cups"/&gt;

  &lt;yield size='10"' descriptive="pie crust"/&gt;
  &lt;yield count="2" size='9"' descriptive="pie crusts"/&gt;</pre>
<hr>

<h4>background:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT background (#PCDATA | emph)*&gt;</pre>

<p>Background elements can describe a story that goes along with the recipe.
This is where additional information can be kept such as "good served with
biscuits" or  "Grandpa's favorite".  Basically this should contain info not
pertaining to additional cooking instructions or serving suggestions.</p>
<hr>

<h4>comment:</h4>
<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT comment (#PCDATA | emph)*&gt;</pre>

<p>Comment elements are intended to provide additional info about the recipe
such as "Makes a firmer topping" in a choice element or "High altitide
directions: Bake an additional 10 minutes." in the recipe element</p>
<hr>

<h4>emph:<pre>&lt;!ELEMENT emph (#PCDATA)&gt;</pre>
</h4>

<p>The "emph" element denoted emphasis and it is likely that the stylesheet
will render in some way to stand out such as bold or italics.</p>
