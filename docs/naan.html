            water in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, 5 to 10
            minutes.</LI><LI>Stir in the remaining sugar, the remaining water, the egg, milk
            and salt.  Add 4 cups of the flour and stir to form a dough that
            is soft and pliable, but not sticky. Knead the dough until smooth
            and elastic. Add as much of the remaining flour as necessary.
            It should take 6 to 8 minutes.</LI><LI>Use 1/2 tablespoon of the oil to lightly oil a large bowl. Place
            the dough in the bowl, brush the top with the remaining oil,
            cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm,
            draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch
            down the dough and pinch off 2-inch pieces. Roll them between
            your palms into smooth balls. you should have 14 to 16 balls.
            Place the balls on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with
            a lightly dampened clean kitchen towel. Let rise again until
            puffy, about 30 minutes.</LI><LI>Preheat grill to high.</LI><LI>When ready to cook, place a rolling pin, cutting board, bowl of
            flour, and the melted butter near the grill. Roll out a dough ball
            on a lightly floured cutting board to for a disk about 5 inches
            in diameter. Gently slap the disk from one hand to the other to
            stretch it into an elongated 7 to 8 inch circle. Stretch the
            circle into a traditional teardrop shape and immediately lay it
            on the hot grate.</LI><LI>Cook the bread until the bottom is crusty and browned and the
            top is puffed and blistered, 2 to 4 minutes. Brush with butter.
            Invert the naan and grill the other side until lightly browned,
            2 to 4 minutes. Prepare the remaining naan the same way. Brush
            each naan with more butter as it comes off the grill and serve
            while piping hot. Serve whole, or cut each naan into 3 wedges to
            serve the traditional way.</LI></OL>
